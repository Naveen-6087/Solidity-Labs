# 🧪 solidity-labs

Welcome to **solidity-labs** — my personal lab for exploring, building, and experimenting with smart contracts using **Solidity** and **Remix IDE**.

> This is a passion project aimed at mastering Solidity through hands-on coding. Progress may be non-linear due to exams and other commitments.

## 📚 Focus Areas

- Core Solidity concepts and contract architecture  
- Token standards: ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155  
- DeFi components: staking, vaults, DAOs, lending  
- Security: reentrancy, upgradeability, access control  
- Gas efficiency and real-world contract design

## 📝 Notes

Any important learnings, patterns, or pitfalls are documented alongside each contract or in the `/notes` folder.
